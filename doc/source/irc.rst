Install an IRC Program

a terminal and type::

For Windows environment, download latest Hexchat installation binary from
`Hexchat download <https://hexchat.github.io/downloads.html>`__ and
install it.
You will probably also need extra components shown just under Hexchat.

Now open the hexchat program just like you would for any Linux program.

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* If you get a notice that the nick name is already taken, quit and go back to
  the first set of steps to pick a different nickname.


Register Your Nick Name
-----------------------
If all goes well we should get a dialog window indicating the connection to
freenode has completed, and what to do next.. For now we'll select "Nothing,
I'll join a channel later."

When you login to the server for the first time with your nickname, its being
used by you, but it's still not registered yet.

In order to register we need to send a message to nickserv on freenode, which
is a bot that allows us to register and identify ourselves as the owner of
a nick name.

Type the following to register your nick name with nickserv replacing
**mysecretpassword** and **test@domain.com** with your own password and email
address::

  /msg nickserv register mysecretpassword test@domain.com

.. image:: _assets/irc/linux/4.png

If all goes well you should receive a message back instantly that the nick name
is registered by you and an activation email will be sent to the email address
you provided.



Auto-Login On Connecting To Freenode
------------------------------------
In order to identify ourselves that we own the nick name upon logging in, we
need to tell Hexchat to communicate our password over upon connecting.

#. Click **Hexchat** from the menu and then click **Network List**. We will see
   a familiar first screen of servers listed. Make sure freenode is highlighted
   and click **edit**.
#. In the **Password** put in the password we picked in the previous
   step and click close.
