Setup Your Bug Tracker Account
==============================

.. note::
   The OpenStack community is currently in the process of moving from the bug
   tracking software Launchpad to StoryBoard. Further in the project specific
   on-boarding documentation, give special attention if the project is using
   Launchpad or StoryBoard.

StoryBoard
----------

What is StoryBoard?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`StoryBoard <https://storyboard.openstack.org>`_ is  bug tracking software the
OpenStack community is `developing
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/StoryBoard>`_, and in the progress of
`migrating towards
<http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/openstack-gerrit-storyboard-integration/>`_.
Some `projects are already using it
<https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/project/list>`_.

Sign Up
^^^^^^^
#. Go to the `storyboard.openstack.org <https://storyboard.openstack.org>`_.
#. On the top right corner, click the **login** button.
#. If you already have an Ubuntu One Account, you can just login.
#. If you don't have a Ubuntu One Account, click the **I am a new Ubuntu One
   user**.
#. Fill in your email address, name, password, and accepting the terms of
   services.

Launchpad
---------

What is Launchpad?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/openstack>`_ is the legacy way the OpenStack
community does bug tracking since we started `moving towards StoryBoard
<http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/openstack-gerrit-storyboard-integration>`_.

Sign Up
^^^^^^^
You're already signed up. Launchpad uses your Ubuntu One account for
authentication like StoryBoard.
